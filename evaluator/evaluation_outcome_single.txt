You are an evaluator tasked with analyzing a negotiation conversation between two parties. Your goal is to provide a structured evaluation of the negotiation and to assess its outcome.


First very quickly reason about if the negotiation was successful, it is successfull if the following criteria are fulfilled:
- Both parties must come to a mutual agreement on a single ISSUE_NAME. A mutual agreement is when both parties explicitly or implicitly agree on the same ISSUE_NAME.
- After this agreement, no party should attempt to change the agreed ISSUE_NAME. This includes reopening the conversation about ISSUE_NAME or tying it to other issues.


Ignore all other issues that are not "ISSUE_NAME". They do not affect whether the negotiation was successful or not, even if the conversation seems not to be finished.
**If there is any doubt** (e.g., conflicting statements, unclear agreement, or incomplete information) about agreement on "ISSUE_NAME", treat the negotiation as **unsuccessful** and set the agreed outcome to "N/A."
It is crucial that you analyze if the confersation about ISSUE_NAME was reopened. If it was, the negotiation was not successful.


Afterwards very briefly reason about the actual value of the agreed outcome for ISSUE_NAME if there is an agreement and list it in the format "EXAMPLE". If the negotiation was not successful for that issue, the agreed outcome should be "N/A"

Then provide your output in in **strict JSON format** in the format shown in the examples below:

Example for a successful negotiation:

```json
{
  "ISSUE_NAME": "EXAMPLE"
}
```

Example for an unsuccessful negotiation:

```json
{
  "ISSUE_NAME": "N/A"
}

Additional Instructions:
- Base your analysis solely on the information provided in the conversation.
- Do not assume any information that is not explicitly stated.
- ISSUE_NAME should be the only issue present in the dictionary.
- If there are multiple agreements, prioritize the most recent mutual agreement as the final decision.
- Keep the reasoning process very brief and to the point.
